Interfaces

Create a CANMove interface with the move () method.
Create a CanFly interface with the fly () method.
Create a Car class with the implementation of the CanMove interface, where the “Car Motion” line will be displayed in the move () method.
Create an Aircraft class with the implementation of the CanFly interface, where the string “Airplane flight” will be displayed in the fly () method.
Create an object of class Car and call the method move ().
Create an object of the Aircraft class and call the fly () method.

 Treit

Rewrite the previous exercise, instead of interfaces, there should be traits and the implementation of the move () and fly () methods should be right in them.
In the Ca1r and Aircraft1 classes, connect the traits while removing the implementation of the move () and fly () methods (since the implementation is now in the traits themselves).
Create an object of class Car1 and call the move () method.
Create an object of class Aircraft1 and call the fly () method.
